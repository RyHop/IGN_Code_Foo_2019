This reposistory is meant for the IGN Code Foo 2019 internship. Feel free to have a look at what I've built.

Note:

1. For the Witcher_Geralt_of_Rivia, the correct one is Witcher_Geralt_of_Rivia3. The explantion is this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9CPzM2wids


2. My Introductory Video should include the link to a Youtube Video. The link is: https://youtu.be/jZVe0BV1z-I

3. Here is a link to my PacMan "Kinda the Same" if you want to take a look. It contains the files to build in Unity3d. https://1drv.ms/f/s!AoCNPg9v5NmLqC6i40iUaWA5g04q
